This is the curricular syllabus for a 15-week course on [literate programming](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html). The primary programming languages accommodated as of `r format(Sys.time(), "%B %Y")` are:  

+ R
+ Python
+ Javascript
+ Julia

## Languages

The "glue" of literate programming is markdown. Programming language preferences (such as R) should be considered secondary to the more general practice of wrapping analyses into supporting documentation.

:::

The primary authoring platform is [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), although historical (e.g., $LaTeX$) and contemporary alternatives (e.g., `rMarkdown`) also will be addressed.

## Platform versus Language

$LaTeX$ is technically a typesetting system.

## Intended audience

Graduate students within the social, behavioral, and management sciences who would like to learn how to wrap analyses and supporting documentation within one authoring platform toward producing occupationally relevant...
